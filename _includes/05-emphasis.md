# About me

*Having discovered photoshop in the early 2000's I worked through the Adobe Classroom in a Book training manual and found myself captivated by digital graphic image manipulation. Shortly afterwards I found myself in possession of my own website and domain and with that I began to evolve its content. At that time, websites were a collection of images stuck together with digital glue provided by Dreamweaver. Today the entire website UI is generated by coded input using an HTML template, decorated with CSS and animated by JavaScript. This page reflects my transition into web code literacy in the the year 2020.*
